    "The goal of this project is to build a predictive model for predicting biopsy results for patients at risk of developing cervical cancer. The dataset used for this project was accessed on Kaggle and contains 36 columns: 35 predictor variables consisting primarily on patient history information, and a 'Biopsy' column containing a binary biopsy result from each patient. The goal of this project will be to use this dataset to predict biopsy result for each patient. Because a biopsy is an invasive medical procedure, the ability to predict biopsy results based on patient history is a valuable tool that can prevent unnecessary biopsies. The model used for this project will be a suppor vector machine (SVM) model \n",
    "\n",
    "A primary challenge faced in the development of this model is dealing with missing data. The full dataset contains data from 868 patients. However, only 59 of those 868 patients contain full rows of data without any missing values. Building a predictive model based only on these 59 patients is not nearly as significant as a model based on the full dataset would be. In order to do this, missing values must be intelligently replaced in the dataset with values that will allow those patients to be included in the model without heavily influencing the prediction of the model. This is done by performing a combination of linear/logistic regression using the patient's age values to replace missing values with values consistent with the rest of the dataset based on age.\n",

To address this problem, columns 27 and 28 (containing data related to STD diagnosis, which a large majority of the patients do not have) will be dropped first, then all rows containing NaNs will be dropped.

This model can then be given the age of the patient with the missing data point, and will return a more accurate prediction for the missing variable. This is done using the function(s) below:"
